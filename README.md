# Wisconsin Breast Cancer Classification
In this following project, my goals were to:
- Analyze and clean the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset
- Extract specific variables such as diagnosis, concpoints.mean, fracdim.mean, etc. to analyze numerous logistic regression models
- Compute accuracy and F-score on models to predict whether the diagnosis is malignant or benign
